# EV_fire_extinguisher

Currently contains the sketch model code for thermistor. No dependencies. 

The arduino should already have the code uploaded and should only need to plug into the computer as a power source, but if you need to make changes you can do so in the code and then reupload. 

If it doesn't work at first make sure that under "Tools" board is "Arduino Mega or Mega 2560", processor is "ATmega2560 (Mega 2560)" and that you're using the right port. If you're still getting errors, let me know
